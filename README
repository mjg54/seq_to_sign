seqToSign version 0.9

Prior to running seqToSign, you need to install the following dependencies:
the 'lattice' library for R:
http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lattice/index.html

and the 'sys', 'getopt', 'pyfasta', and 'string' libraries for Python
http://docs.python.org/dev/library/sys
http://docs.python.org/dev/library/getopt
https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyfasta/
http://docs.python.org/dev/library/string

If you have little command line experience, it is best to put the entire "seq_to_sign" folder in your home directory first.

1) navigate to the seq_to_sign folder 
$ cd ~/seq_to_sign

2) Make seqToSign executable:
$ chmod +x seqToSign

3) Change lines 36 and 37 to reflect the directories in which the .R and .py files are stored; this is set if you put the seq_to_sign folder in the home directory.

4) Call the program directly or move it into your $PATH
$ ~/seq_to_sign/seqToSign 

seqToSign usage:

~/seq_to_sign/seqToSign -q ~/seq_to_sign/test_files/naked_dna_quad_cut_freq.txt -m ~/seq_to_sign/test_files/mast.srf.hg19.chr1.txt -f ~/seq_to_sign/test_files/hg19.chr1.fa -n SRF -w 20 -o 1

-q tetranucleotide frequency file
-f genomic fasta file
-m mast input file; perform genomic mast using the fasta file specified by '-f'
-n name of the motif
-w the distance on each side of the motif center that you want to query
-o optional specification of which motif to use in the mast file; default == 1

note that the meme outfile for SRF is also provided in the test_files
